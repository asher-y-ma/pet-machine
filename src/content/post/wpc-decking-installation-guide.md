### I. Advantages and Disadvantages of WPC Decking

#### Advantages
1. **Waterproof and Moisture-resistant**: Solves the problem of wood absorbing moisture and rotting, making it ideal for environments where traditional wood products cannot be used.
2. **Insect and Termite Resistant**: Effectively prevents pest infestation, extending the lifespan of the decking.
3. **Variety of Colors**: Offers a wide range of colors with a natural wood feel and texture. Can be customized according to personal preferences.
4. **High Plasticity**: Easy to shape into various designs, allowing for personalized styles.
5. **Eco-friendly and Non-toxic**: Free from harmful substances like benzene, with a formaldehyde content of only 0.2, meeting European E0 standards. Recyclable, conserving wood resources and promoting sustainable development.
6. **Fire Resistant**: Fire retardant with a B1 fire rating. Self-extinguishing and does not release toxic gases when exposed to fire.
7. **Easy to Process**: Can be cut, drilled, sawed, and painted, making it versatile for various applications.
8. **Simple Installation**: Quick and easy to install, saving time and costs without complicated procedures.
9. **No Cracking, Warping, or Maintenance**: Durable with minimal maintenance; easy to clean, reducing long-term upkeep costs.
10. **Good Sound Insulation**: Provides excellent sound absorption and enhances indoor energy efficiency by up to 30%.

#### Disadvantages
- **Quality Variability**: Market quality varies, and weather resistance may not be as strong as other materials.

### II. WPC Decking Installation Methods

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure the concrete subfloor is level before installation to prevent future issues.

2. **Installing Joists**:
   - Keep the center-to-center distance between joists at **310-410 mm**. Leave a gap of around **10 mm** at the ends for drainage.
   - Ensure the joist joints are offset and not aligned in a straight line. Allow a tolerance of ≤10 mm for spacing and ≤3 mm for flatness. Leave an expansion gap of **8-10 mm** between the decking and walls.

3. **Using Steel Joists**:
   - If the subfloor conditions are unstable, use **galvanized steel joists** instead of WPC joists. Ensure welded areas are treated for rust protection.

4. **Deck Board Spacing**:
   - Adjust the spacing based on temperature, humidity, board length, moisture content, and installation area.

### III. Precautions During Installation

1. **Drilling Pilot Holes**: Due to the high density of WPC materials, always drill pilot holes before fastening with self-tapping screws.
2. **Joist Spacing and Leveling**: Ensure joists are level with a spacing of **300-350 mm**.
3. **Large Area Installation**: For large decking areas, ensure that each deck board does not exceed **2 meters** in length.
4. **Edge Sealing**: Apply edge sealing where necessary for a neat finish.
5. **Curved Decking**: For curved sections, cut each board to fit the required length and angle.
6. **Stair Installation**: Use metal trim for stair edges to protect the WPC decking.
7. **Handling and Usage**: Avoid impacts and dropping heavy items on the decking. Handle carefully during storage, transport, and installation to prevent damage.
